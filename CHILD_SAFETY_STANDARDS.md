# Child Safety Standards - Opinion

**Last updated:** February 17, 2026

Thracian Soft ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to the safety and protection of children. This document outlines our standards and practices for preventing child sexual abuse and exploitation (CSAE) on the Opinion platform.

## 1. Zero Tolerance Policy

We maintain a **zero tolerance policy** toward child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and any form of child exploitation. Any content that sexualizes, endangers, or exploits minors is strictly prohibited and will be immediately removed.

## 2. Age Requirement

- Opinion requires users to be **at least 13 years of age** to create an account.
- Users must provide their age during registration.
- Accounts found to belong to users under 13 will be terminated immediately.

## 3. Content Moderation

- All user-generated content (questions, images) is subject to moderation.
- Users can **report inappropriate content** directly within the app using the report/flag feature.
- Reported content is reviewed promptly by our team.
- Content that violates our policies, including any CSAM or child exploitation material, is removed immediately.

## 4. Reporting Mechanisms

### In-App Reporting
Users can report any content or user by tapping the **flag icon** on any question card. Reports are reviewed by our moderation team.
